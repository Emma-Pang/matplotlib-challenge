250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective of this homework is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

Utilizing matplotlib and pandas I created multiple scatter plots and bar graphs to visualize the data.
